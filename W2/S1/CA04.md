## Problems

1. Create a function `check_ten(n1, n2)` which returns a Boolean True if the sum of the numbers is 10.

2. Create a function `sum_ten(n1, n2)` which returns a Boolean True if the sum of the numbers is 10. Otherwise, return the actual sum value.

3. Create a function `first_upper(astring)` which returns the first letter in the string in upper case.

4. Create a function `last_two(astring)` which returns the last two characters as a tuple. If there are less than two characters, return the value "Error".

5. Create a function `seq_check(numbers)` which when given a list of integers, returns True if the sequence `[1,2,3]` appears somewhere in that list.

6. Create a function `compare_length(s1, s2)` which returns the difference in length between the strings.

7. Create a function `sum_or_max(my_list)`, given a list, if the length of the list is even return the sum of the list. If the length is odd, return the maximum value in that list.
