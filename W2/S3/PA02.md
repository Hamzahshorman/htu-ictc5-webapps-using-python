## Simple Hangman

For this practical assignment you will be building a hangman game. The objective of building this game is to boost your programming skills and understanding of programming logic.

The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. The random module will provide this ability, so line 1 in program imports it.

The Game: Here, a random word (a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game.

When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.

For convenience, we have given length of word + 2 chances. For example, word to be guessed is mango, then user gets 5 + 2 = 7 chances, as mango is a five letter word.
