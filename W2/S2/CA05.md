## Problems

1. Create a function which will print out words that start with `S/s` for any given user input.
2. Create a function which returns a list of all numbers between 1 and 50 that are divisible by 3.
3. Use range() to print all the even numbers from x to y.
4. Go through the string below and if the length of a word is even print "even" instead of the word.
   1. `Print every word in this sentence that has an even number of letters.`
5. Given a sentence, return a sentence with the words reversed.
6. Given an integer n, return True if n is within 20 of either 100 or 200.
7. Given a list of ints, return True if the array contains a 3 next to a 3 somewhere.
8. Given a string, return a string where for every character in the original there are three characters.
9. Write a program that print the integer from 1 to 100. If the number is a multiple of 3, print `Fizz` instead. If the number is a multiple of 5, print `Buzz`. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.
10. Build a [Tic-Tac-Toe](./Tic-Tac-Toe.md) game.
