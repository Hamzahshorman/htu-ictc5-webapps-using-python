## Submission

* Create a folder `PA03_{LASTNAME}_{FIRSTINITIAL}`, move all your files into the folder, and archive it.
* Submit your files on **Microsoft Teams** under **Assignments**.
  * Remember to click the `Turn in` button.
* Try to document your code properly :).
* Try to adhere to the Python language conventions.

## Shapes

For this practical assignment we will be working with many of the OOP concepts we learned in class. Inheritance, polymorphism, and method overriding.

Under the folder [Shapes](./Shapes/) you will find 5 files with some classes to get you started.

 1. Finish the implementation of the classes.
 2. Override `__str__` for `Square`, `Triangle` and `Circle`. 
    * *Think about what you need to do for each one.*
 3. Implement the method `print_information()` to all of `Square`, `Triangle` and `Circle` which prints the information about this shape.
 4. Implement the method `draw_shape(Shape)` on all of the shapes.
 5. Create a `Playground.py` and create one instance of all shapes, print the instances you created. Call the methods `find_area()`, `find_perimeter()` and `find_circumference()`.
 6. Create a class diagram for your project including the inheritance model.
    * Note the attributes and methods for each class.
    * You can find a template [here](./shapes-class-diagram.drawio).
