## Problems

1. Write a program which reads a number `(n)` from the user and the print the sum of all numbers between `1` and `n`.
2. Write a program which prints the following pattern for any given number, `n = 5`, for example.
   * 1 
   * 1 2 
   * 1 2 3 
   * 1 2 3 4 
   * 1 2 3 4 5
3. Write a program which prints the multiplication table of a given number. 
   * `Sample input: n=2`
   * `Sample output: 2x1 = 1, 2x2 = 4, 2x3 = 6, 2x4 = 8, 2x5 = 10 ... 2x10 = 20`
4. Given a list of numbers iterate over it and print numbers which are divisible by `5`. If you find number greater than `150` stop the exit iteration.
5. Given a list of numbers, reverse the list without using the `reverse()` method.
6. Given a string, get the length of the string without using the `len()` function.
7. Write a program which reads the age of 3 different people. Then print the oldest, and youngest between them.
8. Write a program which prints the absolute value of any given number `n`.
