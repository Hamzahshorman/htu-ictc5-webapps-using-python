## Problems

1. Given two lists, create a third list by picking an even-index element from the first list and odd-index element from second.
   1. `first_list = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]`
   2. `second_list = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]`
   3. `results_list = [6, 12, 18, 4, 12, 20, 28]`

2. Given an input list remove the element at index `2` and add it at index `4` position and also, at the end of the list.
   1. `list = [54, 44, 27, 79, 91, 41]` 
   2. `results_list = [54, 44, 27, 79, 27, 91, 41, 27]`
   
3. Given two lists of equal size create a set which contains elements from both lists as a pair.
   1. `first_list = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
   2. `second_list = [4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]`
   3. `results_set = {(2, 4), (3, 9), (5, 25), (6, 36), (7, 49), (8, 64)}`

4. Given a list, remove all duplicate element and create a tuple with the remaining values. Then find the minimum and maximum numbers in that tuple.
   1. `list = [87, 45, 41, 65, 94, 41, 99, 94]`
   2. `tuple = (87,45, 41, 65, 99)`
   3. `min = 41 max = 99`
5. Given a sample dictionary, print the value and type of the key `history`.
   1. `dictionary = {"class":{ "student":{ "name":"Mike","marks": "physics":70, "history":80 }}}}`
6. Given a sample dictionary, print if the value `200` exits.
   1. `dictionary = {'a': 100, 'b': 200, 'c': 300}`
7. Given a tuple `some_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)`, output the reverse of this tuple.
8. Unpack the following tuple then print the values `another_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40)`.
9. Modify the value `22` inside the following tuple to `2222`.
   1.  `tuple = (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)`
10. Swap then print following two tuples.
    1.  `first_tuple = (11, 22)`
    2.  `second_tuple = (99, 88)`


### Advanced Problem
1. Given a list slice it into a three equal slices and reverse each list.
2. Given two lists of equal size create a set which contains elements from both lists as tuples in the set.
3. Given two sets, checks if one set is subset or superset of the other set.
If a subset is found delete all elements from that set.
